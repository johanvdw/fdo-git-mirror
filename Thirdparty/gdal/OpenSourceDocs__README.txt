FDO and Provider API Documentation README
=========================================

This ReadMe contains information about the documentation included with 
this release. The FDO and Provider API documentation is created from the 
FDO and Provider Open Source header files. The documentation is produced 
as HTML, thus requires a browser to view.

After extracting the FDO OpenSource files, extract the FDO OpenSource 
documentation to <Your FDO OpenSource Location>\OpenSource\Fdo\Docs using 
either gunzip/tar or Winzip.

       On Linux or Windows, use the gunzip and tar utilities as follows:

            gunzip fdodocs-3.4.0.tar.gz
            tar -xvf fdodocs-3.4.0.tar

       - or -

       On Windows, use the Winzip utility as follows:

            WINZIP32.EXE fdodocs-3.4.0.tar.gz

For example, once the documentation is extracted, it is located here:
