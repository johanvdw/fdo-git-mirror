<p>The Feature Data Objects (FDO) API provides access to data in a 
data store. A provider is a specific implementation of the FDO API 
that provides access to data in a particular data store. The FDO 
Provider for GDAL provides FDO with access to an GDAL-based data store.

<p>The FDO Provider for GDAL uses the GDAL library for reading a variety 
of raster formats.

For more information, see <i>The Essential FDO</i>,
the <i>FDO Developer's Guide</i> and the GDAL web 
site (<a href="http://www.gdal.org/">www.gdal.org</a>).
