*   The header file defines the structure "dbi_cfl_obj" to store a long *
*   transaction conflict. The structure consists of the primary key for *
*   the object causing the conflict, its class name, the row id, a flag *
*   to indicate the user's request on how to solve the issue and a link *
*   to the next long transaction conflict object.                       *
*                                                                       *
