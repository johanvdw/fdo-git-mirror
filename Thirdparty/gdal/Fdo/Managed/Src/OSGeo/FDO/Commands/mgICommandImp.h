/// ICommand defines behavior common to all commands in FDO. In
/// order to be executed, commands must have an association to a connection.
/// Commands can also be optionally associated with a transaction if the
/// connection supports transactions. The parameter values collection allows
/// values to be specified for commands that support expressions and/or filters.
