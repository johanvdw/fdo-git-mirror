/// \brief
/// The IFeatureCommandImp class is a concrete implementation of IFeatureCommand.
/// IFeatureCommand defines the behavior common to all commands that operate on feature instances. 
/// The features to be operated on are identified by their class and a filter. 
/// If the feature provider supports inheritance in the schema capabilities, then the command 
/// will operate on instances of that class and any derived classes. 
/// In addition, feature commands can operate on related features if one or 
/// more relation directives are specified. Each relation directive specifies 
/// the relation to follow and how many levels of depth to follow it.
