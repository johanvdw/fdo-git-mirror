/// \brief
/// XmlFeatureWriter writes features to an XML document. The features are 
/// written in GML format. Each feature is written in 3 steps:
/// <ol>
/// 	<li> call SetClassDefintion() to define the feature's class name,
/// schema name, and list of valid properties.
/// 	<li> call SetProperty() for each feature property value to set.
/// 	<li> call WriteFeature() to write the feature with the current 
/// property values. The feature's element name is derived from the
/// class and schema name.
/// </ol>
/// WriteFeature() ensures that the properties are written in their proper order. This 
/// may have slight performance implications since this writer has to accumulate the 
/// property values before writing them. If performance is a concern then 
/// XmlFeaturePropertyWriter should be used instead.
