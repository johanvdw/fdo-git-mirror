/// \brief
/// The ConnectionManager class supports dynamic creation of connection objects 
/// given a provider name. Derives from the IConnectionManager interface.
///
/// \remarks
/// In order for dynamic creation to work, each dynamic link library, shared library, 
/// or assembly that implements a provider must supply a well-defined entry point function that 
/// takes as input a provider name and returns an IConnection instance. The definition of the 
/// entry point function is language- and platform-dependent. For this release of FDO, the 
/// windows libraries supporting FDO providers will be expected to support the following well-known 
/// unmanaged entry point function, which will create and return an unitialized connection object:
///
///     FdoIConnection^ CreateConnection();
///
