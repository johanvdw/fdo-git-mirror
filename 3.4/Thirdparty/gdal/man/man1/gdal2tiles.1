.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This utility generates a directory with small tiles and metadata, following OSGeo Tile Map Service Specification. Simple web pages with viewers based on Google Maps and OpenLayers are generated as well - so anybody can comfortably explore your maps on-line and you do not need to install or configure any special software (like mapserver) and the map displays very fast in the webbrowser. You only need to upload generated directory into a web server.
.PP
GDAL2Tiles creates also necessary metadata for Google Earth (KML SuperOverlay), in case the supplied map uses EPSG:4326 projection.
.PP
World files and embedded georeference is used during tile generation, but you can publish a picture without proper georeference too.
