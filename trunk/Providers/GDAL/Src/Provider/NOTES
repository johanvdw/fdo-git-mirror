Class Descriptions
==================




BandRasterCommon / BandRasterAtil
---------------------------------

 o Supports implementation of FdoIRaster.
 o Holds image geometry (bounds, size, resolution), Null, dataModel.
 o Implements important methods such as GetStreamReader().
 o Holds current clipping bounds, palette.
 o Holds a list of GeoBandRasters

Common is generic, and should be reusable as is. 



RasterAtil
----------

 o Implementation of FdoIRaster. 
 o Maintains a concept of a collection of raster bands, 
   each of which is an FdoRfpBandRasterAtil. 
 o Keeps track of which is the "current" band.
 o Defers most methods (bounds, model, getstream, etc) 
   to the current raster band (BandRasterAtil).


CommonReader / DataReader
-------------------------

 o Implements tabular access to list of available rasters (FdoIDataReader) 
 o Provides methods to fetch name, FdoIRaster *, etc.
