	Implement bulk copy. Right now it is not implemented because I don't know how to implment this process parameter.
	When setting parameter I need to add also OTL type for it.

   MsSqlSpatial has a issue. When geometry is type of multipolygon it wan't allow polygon.
   Before that is changed in MsSqlSpatial I willchange that provider will use GEOMTRY type for every multi

   Now when appying schema I commented out generating identity if property is autogenerated and readonly.
   I am adding new column and seting as identity
   That is because if I use existing than fdo2Fdo is not working because it will try to copy also that column
   and sql server would not allow to explicitly set identity ( perhaps to tur on that option in sql server ? )
