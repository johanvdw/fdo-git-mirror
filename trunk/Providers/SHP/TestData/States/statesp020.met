  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set portrays the state boundaries of the United
      States.  The data set was created by extracting the state
      boundary polygons from the individual 1:2,000,000-scale state
      boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files produced by the
      U.S. Geological Survey.  These files were then paneled into a
      single coverage.
    Purpose:
      These data were created to serve as a base layer for the
      National Atlas of the United States of America.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Revisions:
        1) 19980322 - Corrected topological problems in the data
        (slivers along state boundaries).
        2) 19980514 - Minor modifications were made to boundaries
        in Alaska
        3) 6/29/98 - Corrected ellipsoid name from WGS84 to GRS1980 and 
        changed flattening ratio.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Accuracy at the DLG level was tested by one or more of the
      following methods:
      - manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots.
      - symbolized display of the digital line graph on an
      interactive computer graphic
      system.
      - Selected attributes that could not be visually verified
      on plots or on screen were interactively queried and
      verified on screen.

  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the data set was checked for
    label errors, dangling nodes, and intersections.  The data set
    was then built for polygon topology using the "BUILD" command.

  Completeness_Report:
    Data completeness generally reflects the content of the
    original DLG file.

  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        In DLG format, files underwent comparison to a graphic
        source or image source that was used as control to assess
        digital positional accuracy.  During conversion to ARC/INFO
        coverage format and during the MAPJOIN process to panel the
        states together, node snapping and fuzzy tolerances may have
        caused minimal positional shifts.

      Process_Description:
        This file was originally digitized by the National Mapping
        Division based on the sectional maps contained in 'The
        National Atlas of the United States of America' published by
        the USGS in 1970. The sectional maps were updated during
        1978-1981 and digitized in the early 1980's.  The data were
        updated again in the early 1990's by the USGS and published
        on CD-ROM in 1995 as state DLGs.  These state files have
        been recently updated.  Using ARC/INFO software, the DLG
        optional format files were converted to ARC/INFO coverages
        using the DLGARC command.  Only state political boundaries
        and attribute information were extracted for inclusion.  It
        was determined that state boundary lines that crossed open
        water would be excluded for graphic purposes and that
        polygons that represented islands would be attributed with
        the appropriate state information.  The individual state
        coverages were then paneled together using the ARC/INFO
        command MAPJOIN.  "Slivers" created during the MAPJOIN
        process were identified and deleted using the ELIMINATE
        command.  Minor attribute corrections were made, and sliver
        polygons between North Dakota and Montana, and Oregon and
        California were removed.
