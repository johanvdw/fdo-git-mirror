#
# Description: Build the Linux version of the Python wrappers for FDO
#              This script assumes that the following software packages are installed:
#              - SWIG 1.3.24
#              - Python 2.4

#
# GLOBALS
#

#
# Merge the standard FDO header file (found in /usr/local/fdo-3.8.1/include/)
# with the local 'overriding' header files (found in ./Fdo_Inc).  The merged
# files will be put in ./Inc_Merged
#
