/*! \page page1 CHM Usage Notes
The CHM has been created from .NET managed C++ header files using doxygen.
\section interfaces Interface Classes
\par
In general an interface class name is prefixed by a capital I and does not end with 'Imp'. Those classes whose names are prefixed with a capital I and end with 'Imp' inherit from the interface class with the related name. For example, OSGeo::FDO::Commands::Locking::IAcquireLock is the name of an interface class, and OSGeo::FDO::Commands::Locking::IAcquireLockImp is the name of an implementation class which inherits from IAcquireLock.
