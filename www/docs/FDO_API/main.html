<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
<div class="mainpage"></div><p>
<div class="mainpage"></div><p>
<div class="mainpage">The Feature Data Objects (FDO) application programming interface (API) is a set of APIs used to manipulate, define, and analyze geospatial information.  </div><p>
<div class="mainpage">FDO supports the retrieving and updating of spatial and non-spatial GIS feature data through a rich classification model that is based on OpenGIS and ISO standards.  </div><p>
<div class="mainpage">From the perspective of a client application user: the FDO API provides consistent access to feature data, whether it comes from a CAD-based data source, or from a relational data store that supports rich classification. To achieve this, FDO supports a model that can readily follow the capabilities of each data source, allowing for consumer applications functionality that is tailored to match that of the data source. For example, some data sources may support spatial queries, while others do not. Also, a flexible metadata model is required in FDO, allowing clients to adapt to the underlying feature schema exposed by each data source.  </div><p>
<div class="mainpage">From the perspective of a client application engineer: the FDO API provides a common, general purpose abstraction layer for accessing geospatial data from a variety of data sources. The API is, in part, an interface specification of the abstraction layer. A provider, such as FDO Provider for SDF, is an implementation of the interface for a specific type of data source, which in this example is an implementation for Autodesk's spatial database format (SDF). The API can support the standard data store manipulation operations, such as querying, updating, versioning, locking, and others, only when the underlying data store has the same capabilities for these operations.  <h2>Architecture </h2>
</div><p>

<div class="mainpage"></div><p>
<div class="mainpage"> The high-level architecture of FDO comprises feature providers that plug into an application to expose a consistent feature schema and a consistent interface for interacting with geospatial feature data, regardless of the underlying data store. The client applications interact through the various FDO interfaces, such as <a class="el" href="de/d0b/class_fdo_i_connection.html">FdoIConnection</a> or <a class="el" href="d3/dbb/class_fdo_i_command.html">FdoICommand</a>, using an FDO interface layer, or feature access manager.  </div><p>
<div class="mainpage"> FDO is assembled in or consists of conceptual packages of similar functionality. This packaging is reflected in the substructure of the FDO SDK 'includes' folder. FDO commands, provider-specific commands, and connections/capabilities provide access to native data stores through each specific FDO provider. Schema management (using XML), client services, and filters/expressions are all provider-independent packages that connect directly to the FDO API.  </div><p>
