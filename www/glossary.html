	<dt>Feature Schema</dt>
	<dd>
	A set of classes and their corresponding properties and relationships.
	Each Feature Schema typically contains the classes for a specific domain,
	for example, Electrical Schema, Gas Schema, etc.
	The Feature Schema defines its classes in an FDO provider-independent form.

	<dt>Schema</dt>
	<dd>
	In RDBMS terms, a Schema is a collection of tables, indexes, views, etc.
	in a database. Feature and RDBMS schemas do not correspond 1:1.
	A Feature Schema may be stored in different RDBMS schemas
	and an RDBMS schema might be composed of multiple logical schemas.

	<dt>Schema Mapping</dt>
	<dd>
	A set of hints that determine how Feature Schemas are stored
	in an FDO data store.
	The contents of Schema Mappings vary depending on the FDO Provider type. 
	</dd>
	<dt>Tolerance</dt>
	<dd>
	Used to determine when two points are close enough to be considered to be
	equivalent in certain spatial tests. In FDO, the tolerance value is used
	as a radius around a position rather than as a distance along an axis.
	In the majority of cases, the distance between the points is compared
	to the tolerance using the 'less than' predicate. If the X and Y tolerances
	are both 0.05, the point B (1.0, 1.0) is considered to be equivalent to
	point A (0.96, 0.96) and point C (1.04, 1.04), but is not considered to be
	equivalent to point D (0.96, 0.94) or point E (1.04, 1.06). The
	relationship is not transitive. That is, point A is not equivalent to
	point C. Repeated applications of the <strong>isEquivalentTo</strong>
	predicate to the same data always yields the same result.
