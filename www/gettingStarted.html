<h1>FDO Open Source - Getting Started</h1>
<h2>Get the Source and Build the Binaries</h2>
<p>This is described in the build <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The FDO installation path on Linux is fixed. It is /usr/local/fdo-&lt;version&gt;.</p>
<p>The FDO installation path on Windows is configurable using a command-line argument to the build script.</p>
<h2>Setup the C++ Application Development Environment</h2>
	<p>
	Check out the settings in the solution (.sln) and project (.vcproj) files
	found in the FDO source folders on Windows and in the
	makefile.am and configure.in files found in the FDO source directories
	on Linux.
	</p>
	<h3>Windows</h3>
	<p>The assumption is that you are using Visual Studio Express, Standard or Professional 2005.</p>
	<p>
	Use the installation path to set up the environment so that headers
	and libraries can be located at compile time,
	and shared objects can be located at runtime.
	</p>
	<p>
	Use the build path to set up the environment so that the debugger can locate
	program database files (symbol tables) and source files at runtime. 
	<p>
		You can make the various files visible by either setting solution or
		project properties or by setting Visual Studio tool options or by
		setting an environment variable (PATH).		
		</p>
		<p>
			The first step for the properties method is to select the solution
			or project in the Solution Explorer, right-click to its pop-up menu
			and select Properties. The result is that the properties dialog is
			displayed. If the project properties dialog is displayed,
			the second step is to expand 'Configuration Properties' in the
			properties dialog contents pane.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first step for the tool options method is to select 'Options...'
			from the Tools menu in the main menubar.
			The result is that the options dialog is displayed.
		</p>
		<h4>Headers</h4>
		<p>
		In the project properties dialog contents pane expand 'Configuration Properties'
		and then 'C/C++'. Select 'General' and edit 'Additional Include
		Directories'.
		</p>
		<p>
		Alternatively, in the options dialog contents pane expand 'Projects and Solutions' and
		then 'VC++ Directories'. Select 'Include files' from the spinbox labeled
		'Show directories for:'. Follow the procedure for adding a directory.
		</p>
		<h4>Libraries</h4>
		<p>
		In the project properties dialog contents pane expand 'Configuration Properties'
		and then 'Linker'. Select 'General' and edit 'Additional Library
		Directories'.
		</p>
		<p>
		Alternatively, in the options dialog contents pane expand 'Projects and Solutions' and
		then 'VC++ Directories'. Select 'Library files' from the spinbox labeled
		'Show directories for:'. Follow the procedure for adding a directory.
		</p>
		<h4>Dynamically Linked Libraries</h4>
		<p>
		In the options dialog contents pane expand 'Projects and Solutions' and
		then 'VC++ Directories'. Select 'Executables' from the spinbox labeled
		'Show directories for:'. Follow the procedure for adding a directory.
		</p>
		<p>
		Or use XP to set the PATH environment variable to reference the location
		of the DLLs.
		</p>
		<h4>Source Files</h4>
		<p>
		In the solution properties dialog contents pane expand
		'Common Properties'.
		Select 'Debug Source Files'. Follow the procedure for adding a directory.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the options dialog contents pane expand 'Projects and Solutions' and
		then 'VC++ Directories'. Select 'Source files' from the spinbox labeled
		'Show directories for:'. Follow the procedure for adding a directory.
		</p>
		<h4>Symbol Table Files (Program Database Files)</h4>
		<p>
		In the options dialog contents pane expand 'Debugging' and
		then 'Symbols'. Follow the procedure for adding a directory.
		</p>
	<h3>Linux</h3>
	<p>Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.</p>
<h2>Setup the C++ Application Development Environment</h2>
	<p>To be done.</p>
<h2>Access the API Reference Documentation</h2>
<p>
	The API reference documentation has been created by using doxygen to
	process comments in the header files. When doxygen generates the html
	files, it distributes them across a generated file structure to allow
	for quicker access. This prevents direct linking to the class html files.
</p>
<p>
	When you are asked to read FDO C++ class reference documentation, load the
	<a href="https://fdo.osgeo.org/nonav/docs/FDO_API/index.html">FDO C++ API Reference</a>,
	click the Classes tab in the right-hand pane and click on the class name.
</p>
<p>
	When you are asked to read FDO C# class reference documentation, load the
	<a href="https://fdo.osgeo.org/nonav/docs/FDO_API_managed/index.html">FDO .NET API Reference</a>,
	click the Classes tab in the right-hand pane and click on the class name.
</p>
<h2>Write the Code to Connect to a Provider</h2>
<p>Do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Get the list of installed providers</li>
	<li>Create a connection manager</li>
	<li>Create a connection</li>
	<li>Get the connection state</li>
	<li>Get the connection properties</li>
	<li>Get values for the connection properties</li>
	<li>Set the connection properties</li>
	<li>Open a connection</li>
	<li>Open a pending connection</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create a Provider Registry</h3>
	<p>
	The provider registry tells you what providers are installed.
	</p>
	<p>
	Read about the GetProviderRegistry method in the
	<strong>FdoFeatureAccessManager</strong> C++ class reference or the <strong>FeatureAccessManager</strong> C# class reference.
	</p>
<h3>Get the List of Installed Providers</h3>
	<p>
	Read about the GetProviders method in the 
	<strong>FdoProviderRegistry</strong> C++ class reference or the <strong>ProviderRegistry</strong> C# class reference.
	This method returns the contents of the providers.xml file found in the
	&lt;install&gt;/bin folder on Windows and
	in the /usr/local/fdo-&lt;version&gt;/lib directory on Linux.
	</p>
	<p>
	When you create the connection, you will use one of the strings returned
	by this method as an argument.
	</p>
<h3>Create a Connection Manager</h3>
	<p>
	The connection manager creates connections.
	</p>
	<p>
	Read about the GetConnectionManager method in the
	<strong>FdoFeatureAccessManager</strong> C++ class reference or the <strong>FeatureAccessManager</strong> C# class reference.
	</p>
<h3>Create a Connection</h3>
	<p>
	Read about the CreateConnection method in the
	<strong>FdoConnectionManager</strong> C++ class reference or the <strong>IConnectionManagerImp</strong> C# class reference.
	</p>
<h3>Get the Connection State</h3>
	<p>
	At this point the state of the connection is closed.
	</p>
	<p>
	Read about the GetConnectionState method in the
	<strong>FdoIConnection</strong> C++ class reference or the <strong>IConnectionImp</strong> C# class reference.
	</p>
<h3>Get the Connection Properties</h3>
	<p>
	First you get the connection information. Read about the
	GetConnectionInfo method in the <strong>FdoIConnection</strong>
	C++ class reference or the <strong>IConnectionImp</strong> C# class reference.
	</p>
	<p>
	Then you get the connection properties. Read about the
	GetConnectionProperties method in the <strong>FdoIConnectionInfo</strong>
	C++ class reference or the <strong>IConnectionInfoImp</strong> C# class reference.
	This method returns a connection property dictionary.
	</p>
	<p>
	Read about the methods used to access the information in the connection
	properties dictionary in the <strong>FdoIConnectionPropertyDictionary</strong>
	C++ class reference or the <strong>IConnectionPropertyDictionary</strong> C# class reference.
	Using these methods you can find out the names of the properties,
	whether they are optional or mandatory, whether they have default values,
	their type, whether they are enumerable and, if enumerable, what the set
	of enumerated values is.	
	</p>
<h3>Get Values for the Connection Properties</h3>
	<p>
	The types of properties used in connections include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>user names</li>
 		<li>passwords</li>
		<li>file path names</li>
		<li>URLs</li>
		<li>symbolic host names</li>
		<li>service identifiers</li>
		<li>data store names</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Each provider has its own unique set of connection properties.
	The connection properties for the various providers
	are described in
	<a href="docs/FET_TheEssentialFDO.pdf">The Essential FDO (PDF)</a>.
	</p>
<h3>Set the Connection Properties</h3>
	<p>
	Read about the methods used to access the information in the connection
	properties dictionary in the <strong>FdoIConnectionPropertyDictionary</strong>
	C++ class reference or the <strong>IConnectionPropertyDictionary</strong> C# class reference.
	</p>
<h3>Open a Connection</h3>
	<p>
	Read about the Open method in the <strong>FdoIConnection</strong> C++ class
	reference or the <strong>IConnectionImp</strong> C# class reference.
	</p>
<h3>Open a Pending Connection</h3>
	<p>
	Each of the RDBMS-based providers has a connection property, which is there
	to contain the name of a data store. The data store property is initially
	not required in order to make a connection. If the property is not set,
	then the resulting connection, if successful, is in a pending state.
	</p>
	<p>
	As a result of the initial connection operation, the data store property is
	populated with the names of the data stores in the RDBMS, and its optionality
	attribute is changed to a value of required.
	</p>
	<p>
	Use the EnumeratePropertyValues method on the
	<strong>FdoIConnectionPropertyDictionary</strong> (C++) object or the <strong>IConnectionPropertyDictionary</strong> (C#) object 
	to read the set of data store names and set the data store property
	in the dictionary object to one of those names.
	Then call the Open method on the <strong>FdoIConnection</strong> (C++) object
	or the <strong>IConnectionImp</strong> (C#) object again. This will result in a fully open connection.
	</p>
	<p>
	You can connect to an ArcSDE provider using a pending connection, you will
	find that there is only ever one name in the set of data store names 
	returned as a result of the initial connection.
	</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<h3>ArcSDE Provider</h3>
<p>
You use this provider to connect to an ArcSDE server, which is, in turn,
connected to an Oracle or SQL Server data source.
</p>
<p>The next step is to determine the number and composition of feature schema
in the data store so that you can execute data maintenance (insert, update,
and delete) and query (select) commands.</p>
<h3>MySQL Provider</h3>
<p>The next steps are to create a data store and a user, and after that,
create a feature schema and execute data maintenance and query commands.
</p>
<h3>SDF, SHP and ODBC Providers</h3>
<p>The next steps are to create a feature schema and execute data
maintenance and query commands.
<h3>WFS and WMS Providers</h3>
<p>The next steps are to determine the composition of the feature schema and
execute query commands.</p>
