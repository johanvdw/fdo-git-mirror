  <h1>Feature Data Objects - Project Home</h1>
  Welcome to the home of Feature Data Objects.
  <p>FDO Open Source is a new Data Objects API that was originally developed by Autodesk and contributed to the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. Learn more, get involved or download the software today. There are several ways to participate either as a <a href="user.html">user</a> or <a href="developer.html">contributor</a>. Your participation is welcome!</p>
  <div class="h2"><h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Feature Data Objects (FDO) is an API for manipulating, defining, and analyzing geospatial information regardless of where it is stored. FDO uses a provider-based model for supporting a variety of geospatial data sources, where each provider typically supports a particular data format or data store.</p>
  <p>At this point Feature Data Objects is being offered as a preview for use with MapGuide Open Source. The links below  allow you to download a full copy of the source code with FDO providers for ESRI SHP and a new format created for MapGuide called the Spatial Database Format (SDF). FDO will become a full open-source project in the coming months, so stay tuned to this page for more information, additional providers, and the launch of FDO as an active open source project. </p>
  <p>Feature Data Objects is free, open source software licensed under the <a href="lgpl.html">LGPL</a>.</p>
