  <h1>Feature Data Objects - Project Home</h1>
  Welcome to the home of Feature Data Objects.
  <div class="h2"><h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Feature Data Objects (FDO) is an API for manipulating, defining, and analyzing geospatial information regardless of where it is stored. FDO uses a provider-based model for supporting a variety of geospatial data sources, where each provider typically supports a particular data format or data store.</p>
  <p>At this point Feature Data Objects is being offered as a preview for use with MapGuide Open Source. The links below  allow you to download a full copy of the source code with FDO providers for ESRI SHP and a new format created for MapGuide called the Spatial Database Format (SDF). FDO will become a full open-source project in the coming months, so stay tuned to this page for more information, additional providers, and the launch of FDO as an active open source project. </p>
  <p>Feature Data Objects is free, open source software licensed under the <a href="lgpl.html">LGPL</a>.</p>
