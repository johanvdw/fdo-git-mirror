//
// This file is used by the SQLServerSpatial provider and serves 2 purposes:
//
//    1. It gets WKT for coordinate systems that are not in SQL Server's sys.spatial_reference_systems catalogue.
//       This catalogue only contains Geodetic coordinate systems. However, SQL Server geometry column
//       values can be associated with coordinate systems that are not in the catalogue. These coordinate systems
//       are referenced by SRID (usually EPSG number). The SQLServerSpatial provider generates a spatial
//       context for each of these coordinate systems. It also needs to determine the WKT 
//       (Well-Known Text) for each coordinate system, since that information is needed by FDO API consumers such as
//       AutoCAD Map 3D and Autodesk MapGuide. This file provides a supplemental place to retrieve the WKT by mapping 
//	 SRIDs to WKTs. The SQL Server catalogue is checked first, and then this file, so for SRID's in 
//       sys.spatial_reference_systems, the WKT is retrieved from sys.spatial_reference_systems, and not this file.
//        
//
//    2. This file allows the provider to handle coordinate system names specified via the FdoICreateSpatialContext 
//       command. If the coordinate system name is not in the SQL Server catalogue, the SQLServerSpatial provider 
//       stores its SRID in the new datastore. This file is needed to translate the coordinate system name to SRID. 
//
// This file provides a starter set of coordinate systems, but you can add more as needed. Store this file 
// in the FDO com directory (A sub-directory named 'com' that is in the same directory as the SQLServerSpatial 
// provider DLL). The starter file does not define the WKT strings. You will have to add the WKT for any 
// coordinate systems that you use. 
//
// The format for each line in this file is:
//
//     <SRID> <Coordinate System Name> <WKT>
//
// where:
//     SRID: The SRID for each coordinate system. For the initial coordinate system entries, the SRID
//         is the coordinate system's EPSG number.
//
//     Coordinate System Name: The name that appears on the Map Create Datastore Plugin for SQLServerSpatial. 
//         You can omit this if it is not one of the coordinate systems available from the Plugin.
//
//     WKT: A string in Open Geospatial Well-Known Text format. You can omit this if the coordinate system is in 
//         sys.spatial_reference_systems. If you omit it, you must specify the Coordinate System Name.
//
// Each field must be separated by spaces (not tabs). 
//
// The Coordinate System Name can have embedded spaces. All words after the EPSG number and before the WKT are treated 
// as part of the Coordinate System name. Any space separation between these words is maintained, but the name cannot 
// have leading or trailing spaces.
