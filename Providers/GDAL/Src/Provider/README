	GDAL FDO Raster Provider
	========================



Implemented
===========

 o Support for reading file(s) based on DefaultRasterFileLocation
   in the connection string. 
 o Support for reading files based on a config document (same format  
   as for Rfp provider). 
 o Supports reading Byte, Int16, UInt16, Int32, UInt32, and Float32 
   datatypes.
 o Supports resizing image (SetImageXSize(), SetImageYSize()) (changing
   resolution).
 o Supports reading NullPixel() (with some limitations).
 o Selecting an area (clipping) using SetBounds().
 o Selects Grey, paletted, RGB and RGBA image configurations. 
 o Reading in pixel interleaved row-by-row order. 
 o Linux builds. 
 

Not Implemented
===============

 o Rotated datasets.
 o Multiple datasets (mosaiced). 
 o 1bit (bitonal). 
 o Proper SRS handling. 
 o Converting data types (Int16 -> Byte). 
 o Converting color models (RGBA -> RGB). 
 o Reading in tiled format (other than one big tile
   or "strip" tiles). 
 o Reading line or band (image) interleaved.
 o Generic metadata. 
 o Selecting bands. 
 o Single threaded GDAL access. 
 o Windows builds. 
 o Unit tests. 


Key Classes
===========

FdoRfpImage: Hold access information about a GDALDataset, the bands, 
             and datatype.

FdoRfpBandRaster: Implement most of the IRaster methods from a single
                  GDAL file.

FdoRfpRasterUtil: Code to fetch imageinfo and georef when building up
                  the raster list resultset.

FdoRfpStreamReaderByTile: The actual stream reader used to read
                          from GDAL.
